## What is a system?

In a very general sense, a system is a **collection of interacting elements** that together produce, by virtue of their interactions, some form of **system-wide behavior**. [@bertalanffy1968]

## What is a complex system? {.nostretch .smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 0.9em; padding-top: 0px;"}
There are several definitions. Here are some:

* "Systems that don't yield to compact forms of representation or description" (David Krakauer in @mitchell2013);
* "A system of many interacting parts where the system is more than just the sum of its parts" (Mark Newman in @mitchell2013);
* Systems with many connected agents that interact and exhibit self-organization and emergence behavior, all without the need for a central controller (Camilo Rodrigues Neto).
* Dialectics at its finest (my working definition).

## Complex structures {.nostretch .smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 1em; padding-top: 0px;"}
A system can be considered complex if it is composed of:

- Diverse entities.
- Interdependent.
- Connected.
- Adaptive.

There seems to be no complexity at the extremes of the intervals. Our society is complex because it lies between the extremes.

## Generative science: a new approach to doing science? {.smaller}

"Simulation is **a third way of doing science**. Like **deduction**, it starts with a set of explicit assumptions. But unlike deduction, it does not prove theorems. Instead, a simulation generates data that can be analyzed inductively. Unlike typical **induction**, however, the simulated data comes from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than direct measurement of the real world. While induction can be used to find patterns in data, and deduction can be used to find consequences of assumptions, simulation modeling can be used as **an aid intuition**."

Induction and deduction combined. Deduction is used to generate data that can be analyzed inductively.

Here we recognize the basic idea of generative science which is **to generate apparently unanticipated and infinite behavior** based on deterministic and finite rules and parameters reproducing or resembling the behavior of natural and social phenomena.

Possible states, even if unlikely: by modelling such interactions, it can suggest that **properties exist in the system that had not been noticed in the real world situation**.

# Entering the world of agent-based models

## Agent-based models

Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational modeling paradigm that enables us to describe how any agent will behave. The methodology of ABM encodes the behavior of individual agents in **simple rules** so that we can observe the results of these agents’ interactions. This technique can be used to model and describe a wide variety of processes, phenomena, and situations, but **it is most useful when describing these phenomena as complex systems**.

ABM and **stochasticity**.

## What is a model? {.smaller}

A model is a simplified representation of a system. It can be conceptual, verbal, diagrammatic, physical, or formal (mathematical).

A good model is simple, valid, and robust.

## Basics of agent-based modeling (ABM)

[...] agent-based modeling is clearly a powerful tool in the analysis of spatially distributed systems of heterogeneous autonomous actors with bounded information and computing capacity.

## Key components and how they work

- Agents
- Environment
- Interaction

## IBMs *versus* ABMs

There have been historical differences between individual- and agent-based models: IBMs focused on individual variability and local interactions, whereas ABMs focused on decision-making and adaptive behavior. But **these differences are fading away** [...]

Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are typically used in social sciences and economics, while Individual-Based Models (IBMs) are commonly used in ecology and biology.

# Final remarks

## Summary of key takeaways

**Complex systems** are systems with many interconnected parts that exhibit emergent behavior.

**Agent-based models** are stochastic computational models with the purpose of simulating the behavior of agents and their interactions, allowing us to study emergent phenomena.

**ABMs** are useful for modeling complex systems and can be used in a wide variety of fields, including social sciences, epidemiology, archaeology, ecology, and many others.

## (AP) Chaos {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

Although the detailed behavior of a chaotic system cannot be predicted, **there is some “order in chaos”** seen in universal properties common to large sets of chaotic systems, such as the period-doubling route to chaos and Feigenbaum’s constant. Thus even though “prediction becomes impossible” at the detailed level, there are some higher-level aspects of chaotic systems that are indeed predictable.

*Nous devons done envisager l'etat présent de l'univers, comme l'effet de son état antérieur, et comme la cause de celui qui va suivre. Une intelligence qui pour un instant donné, connaîtrait toutes les forces dont la nature est animée, et la situation respective des êtres qui la composent, si d'ailleurs elle était assez vaste pour soumettre ces données à l'analyse, embrasserait dans la même formule les mouvemens des plus grands corps de l'univers et ceux du plus léger atome: rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et l'avenir comme le passé, serait présent à ses yeux*.

We ought then to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its anterior state and as the cause of the one which is to follow. Given for one instant an intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by which nature is animated and the respective situation of the beings who compose it - an intelligence sufficiently vast to submit these data to analysis - it would embrace in the same formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the lightest atom; for it, nothing would be uncertain and the future, as the past, would be present to its eyes.

## (AP) Human difficulties in understanding complex systems {visibility="uncounted"}

"Primate brain": Human beings have difficulty understanding complex systems because they are not designed to do so. Our brains evolved to deal with the immediate environment, not to understand the intricacies of the global economy or the climate system.

Humans have difficult to simulate steps in their minds. We are not good at understanding exponential growth, for example.

## (AP) Dialectical materialism's conjecture {visibility="uncounted"}

Materialists, on the other hand, believe that **only matter and its physical properties are real, while mind, thoughts, and the like are simply manifestations of matter**. The idealist tries to explain physical matter as a by-product of mind; the materialist tries to explain mind as a by-product of matter.

The 4 Fundamental Laws of Dialectical Materialism by Engels and Marx (in opposition to Hegel's idealist dialectic, inspired by Heraclitus):

1. **Reciprocal action of matter in motion**.
2. The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa.
3. The law of the interpenetration of opposites.
4. The law of the negation of the negation.

No phenomenon in nature can be understood if considered in isolation, separate from surrounding phenomena.

**The error [of Hegel]** lies in the fact that these laws, as laws of thought, are imposed on nature and history, rather than being deduced from them.

**Dialectics as the science of interconnections** (sound familiar?).

## (AP) Dialetics and the Law of excluded middle {visibility="uncounted"}

Dialectical materialism will consider that something can be both A and not-A at the same time. This is in opposition to the [Law of excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle), which states that something can only be A or not-A. It assumes a [paraconsistent logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraconsistent_logic), instead of a [classical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic).

## (AP) Dialetics: a non-falsiable conjecture {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

Dialectics must be understood as an non-falsifiable conjecture. It should be an inspiration, **but never as something given**. Similar to the Free energy principle (FEP) proposed by Karl Friston [@friston2010].

"The whole development of dialectic should be a warning against the dangers inherent in philosophical system-building. It should remind us that **philosophy must not be made a basis for any sort of scientific system** and that philosophers should be much more modest in their claims. One task which they can fulfill quite usefully is the study of the critical methods of science." [@popper2002]


## (AP) Popper *versus* Dialetical materialism {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

Popper disagrees that physical reality develops dialectically.

Popper interprets Marx as an economic determinist and historicist.

Popper views Marx’s predictions, based on dialectical materialism, as something exact, subject to testing and refutation. At the same time, he points out that some of Marx’s predictions did not hold up when tested against history.

Although Popper praises Marx for his anti-dogmatic stance, he argues that criticisms of dialectical materialism were never tolerated by orthodox Marxists.

Popper asserts that the dialectical method is dangerous because it can be used as a form of evasion, thus becoming a tool for reinforcing dogma.

## (AP) Popper *versus* Dialetical materialism {visibility="uncounted"}

[...] I want to stress the point that although I should not describe myself as a materialist, **my criticism is not directed against materialism, which I personally should probably prefer to idealism if I were forced to choose (which happily I am not). It is only the combination of dialectic and materialism that appears to me to be even worse than dialectic idealism**.

## (AP) Popper *versus* Dialetical materialism {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

"Nevertheless I personally think that Marx’s economism — his emphasis on the economic background as the ultimate basis of any sort of development — is mistaken and in fact untenable." [@popper2002]

"According to the materialist conception of history, the ultimately determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life. More than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted. **Hence if somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the only determining one, he transforms that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase**." [@engels1978a]

## (AP) Popper *versus* Dialetical materialism {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

For our present purpose it is not so important to analyse Marx’s materialism and economism as to see what has become of the dialectic within his system.
Two points seem to me important. One is Marx’s emphasis on historical method in sociology, a tendency which I have called ‘historicism’. The other is the anti- dogmatic tendency of Marx’s dialectic.

Hence, Marx’s anti-dogmatic attitude exists only in the theory and not in the practice of **orthodox Marxism**, and dialectic is used by Marxists, following the example of Engels’ Anti-Dühring, mainly for the purposes of apologetics to defend the Marxist system against criticism. As a rule critics are denounced for their failure to understand the dialectic, or proletarian science, or for being traitors. **Thanks to dialectic the anti-dogmatic attitude has disappeared, and Marxism has established itself as a dogmatism which is elastic enough, by using its dialectic method, to evade any further attack. It has thus become what I have called a reinforced dogmatism**.

Prophecy certainly need not be unscientific, as predictions of eclipses and other astronomical events show. But *Hegelian dialectic, or its materialistic version, cannot be accepted as a sound basis for scientific forecasts*.

Thus if forecasts based on dialectic are made, some will come true and some will not. In the latter case, obviously, a situation will arise which has not been foreseen. But **dialectic is vague and elastic enough to interpret and to explain this unforeseen situation just as well as it interpreted and explained the situation which it predicted and which happened to come true. Any development whatever will fit the dialectic scheme; the dialectician need never be afraid of any refutation by future experience**.

## (AP) Popper's hypothetico-deductive method {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

The activity can be represented by a *general schema of problem- solving by the method of imaginative conjectures and criticism*, or, as I have often called it, by *the method of conjecture and refutation*. The schema (in its simplest form) is this:

Here $\text{P}_1$, is the *problem* from which we start, $\text{TT}$ (the ‘tentative theory’) is the imaginative conjectural solution which we first reach, for example our first *tentative interpretation*. $\text{EE}$ (‘*error- elimination*’) consists of a severe critical examination of our conjecture, our tentative interpretation: it consists, for example, of the critical use of documentary evidence and, if we have at this early stage more than one conjecture at our disposal, it will also consist of a critical discussion and comparative evaluation of the competing conjectures. $\text{P}_2$ is the problem situation as it emerges from our first critical attempt to solve our problems.
It leads up to our second attempt (*and so on*).

## (AP) Popper's hypothetico-deductive method {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

The history of ideas teaches us very clearly that ideas emerge in logical or, if the term is preferred, in **dialectical contexts**. My various schemata such as

$$
\text{P}_1 \rightarrow \text{TT} \rightarrow \text{EE} \rightarrow \text{P}_2
$$

may indeed be looked upon as improvements and rationalizations of the Hegelian dialectical schema: they are rationalizations because they operate entirely within the classical logical organon of rational criticism, which is based upon the so-called law of contradiction; that is to say, upon the demand that contradictions, whenever we discover them, must be eliminated. Critical error-elimination on the scientific level proceeds by way of a **conscious search for contradictions**.

## (AP) Popper against positivism (or the problem of induction) {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

“*Notre activité intellectuelle est suffisamment excitée par le pur espoir de découvrir les lois des phénomènes, par le simple désir de **confirmer** ou d'infirmer une théorie. [...] la philosophie positive est le véritable **état définitif** de l'intelligence humaine [...]*” [@comte1892, pp. 9-10]

**Why post-positivist?**

- Anti-positivist (positive: “imposed on the mind by experience”).
- Anti-inductivist (deduction, satisfactory answers).
- Anti-verificationist (falsifiability as demarcation criterion).

## (AP) Popper against positivism (or the problem of induction) {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

But I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience. These considerations suggest that **not the _verifiability_ but the _falsifiability_ of a system is to be taken as a criterion of demarcation**. In other words: I shall not require of a scientific system that it shall be capable of being singled out, once and for all, in a positive sense; but I shall require that its logical form shall be such that it can be singled out, by means of empirical tests, in a negative sense: *it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience*.

Everybody knows nowadays that **logical positivism is dead**.

(Passmore’s excellent historical article does not raise this question.) **I fear that I must admit responsibility**."

(@) Confirming evidence should not count *except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory*; and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory. (I now speak in such cases of ‘corroborating evidence’).

(@) Some genuinely testable theories, when found to be false, are still upheld by their admirers—for example by introducing *ad hoc* some auxiliary assumption, or by re-interpreting the theory *ad hoc* in such a way that it escapes refutation. Such a procedure is always possible, but it rescues the theory from refutation only at the price of destroying, or at least lowering, its scientific status. (I later described such a rescuing operation as a ‘*conventionalist twist*’ or
a ‘*conventionalist stratagem*’).
