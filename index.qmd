# Key concepts in complex systems

## Complex _versus_ complicated {.smaller}

A biological clock is complex, but a mechanical clock is complicated.

Elegant and Precise

A watchmaker designed it. It has a specific function. It has a goal.

It may be hard to understand, but if you take the time and look at all of its parts, you can understand the whole system.

A mess! An OCD nightmare.

A bunch of coupled oscillators

"[...] involve great numbers of parts undergoing a kaleidoscopic array of simultaneous interactions." [@holland1992b]

If you look just its parts, you can't understand the whole system.

It's an emergent phenomenon

It can be thought as an "aggregate agent" ― aggregate behavior of component agents generates behavior of the aggregate agent. [@holland2012]

Boundaries and signals [@holland2012]

It's adaptive, robust, produces extreme events, and is self-organized.

## Complex _versus_ complicated {.smaller}

If you think about it, the extensive clock control is like a finely-tuned choreography. Everything is organized to happen at the right time, just like a **Rube Goldberg machine** [@merrow2020].

::: {.notes}
If someone designed this here, they weren't doing well. This system wasn't designed by a watchmaker, but by evolution.

This is the result of a juggling act of billions of years of evolution. There are no specific functions. There's no proposed goal.

You would hate have this clock. You would be late for everything. Its always changing. That's because it's not a clock, it's a timing system.
:::

## Complex _versus_ complicated {.smaller}

If you look just the parts of a complex system, you can't understand the whole system.

**A aggregate behavior emerges** from the interactions of the parts

Illustrative example: Immune cells

## What is a system? {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" style="padding-top: 0px;"}
In a very general sense, a system is a **collection of interacting elements** that together produce, by virtue of their interactions, some form of system-wide behavior [@vonbertalanffy1968]

A system is **defined by an observer** and may have an arbitrary content domain [@bao2018]

**The structure of complex systems creates their behavior** [@sterman2000] (the system as cause)

## What is a complex system? {.nostretch .smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 0.9em; padding-top: 0px;"}
Systems that don't yield to compact forms of representation or description (David Krakauer in @mitchell2013)

A system of many interacting parts where the system is **more than just the sum of its parts** (Mark Newman in @mitchell2013)

A system that involves a large number of parts undergoing a kaleidoscopic array of simultaneous interactions, exhibiting **aggregate behavior** that cannot be simply derived from the actions of the individual parts [@holland1992b]

Systems with many connected agents that interact and exhibit self-organization and **emergence behavior**, all without the need for a central controller (Camilo Rodrigues Neto)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 1em; padding-top: 0px;"}
A system can be considered complex if its entities are:

- Diverse
- Interdependent
- Connected
- Adaptive

**There seems to be no complexity at the extremes of the intervals**. Our society is complex because it lies between the extremes.

Deterministic nonperiodic flow [@lorenz1963]

Systems in which this is the case are said to be **sensitively dependent on initial conditions** [@lorenz2008]

**Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set off a Tornado in Texas?** [@lorenz2008]

The behavior of some **simple**, **deterministic** systems **can be impossible, even in principle, to predict in the long term**, due to sensitive dependence on initial conditions [@mitchell2009]

**Order in chaos**: You can't predict how any individual state will evolve, but you can say how a collection of states evolves [@muller2019]

## Equilibrium states {.smaller}

Systems in a highly stable state (**deep valley**) have low potential energy, and considerable energy is required to move them out of this stable state. Systems in an unstable state (top of a hill) have high potential energy, and they require only a little additional energy to push them off the hill.

## Generative science: a new approach to science? {.smaller}
**Simulation is a third way of doing science**

Like **deduction**, it starts with a set of explicit assumptions. But unlike deduction, it does not prove theorems. Instead, a simulation generates data that can be analyzed inductively.

Unlike typical **induction**, however, the simulated data comes from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than direct measurement of the real world

While induction can be used to find patterns in data, and deduction can be used to find consequences of assumptions, simulation modeling can be used as **an aid intuition**

# Entering the world of agent-based models

## Agent-based models {.smaller}

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%" style="padding-top: 0px;"}
Agent-based models (ABMs) are **bottom-up stochastic computational models** with the purpose of simulating the behavior of agents and their interactions, allowing us to study **emergent phenomena**

Instead of describing a system only with variables representing the state of the whole system [a **global approach**], we model its individual agents [a **local approach**] [@railsback2019]

Agents often represent people or other animals, but **agents can also represent anything** from biological cells to economic firms to political municipalities. [@smaldino2023]

# Final remarks

## Summary of key takeaways

**Complex systems** are systems with many interconnected parts that exhibit emergent behavior

**Agent-based models** are stochastic computational models with the purpose of simulating the behavior of agents and their interactions, allowing us to study emergent phenomena

**ABMs** are useful for modeling complex systems and can be used in a wide variety of fields, including social sciences, epidemiology, archaeology, ecology, and many others

The new soup is the soup of human culture. We need a name for the new replicator, **a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission**, or a unit of *imitation*. ‘Mimeme’ comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like ‘gene’. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate *mimeme* to _**meme**_.

## (AP) Complex _versus_ complicated {visibility="uncounted"}

From the **etymological perspective**, “complicated” and “complex” share the same preﬁx “com”, which means together in its Proto-indo-european (PIE) root. But “complicated” comes from the Latin verb **“plicare”** which means fold (noun, as in ten folds) and implies many; “complex” has the Latin root, **“plectere”**, which means **braiding, linking, weave, interlace, and intertwine**. Thus, complex has the implication of interaction and intertwining be- sides the meaning of “many parts” shared with complicated.

Although the detailed behavior of a chaotic system cannot be predicted, **there is some “order in chaos”** seen in universal properties common to large sets of chaotic systems, such as the period-doubling route to chaos and Feigenbaum’s constant. Thus even though “prediction becomes impossible” at the detailed level, there are some higher-level aspects of chaotic systems that are indeed predictable.

Con el tiempo, esos Mapas Desmesurados no satisfacieron y los Colegios de Cartógrafos levantaron un Mapa del Imperio, que tenía el tamaño del Imperio y coincidía puntualmente con él. Menos Adictas al Estudio de la Cartografía, las Generaciones Siguientes entendieron que __ese dilatado Mapa era Inútil__ y no sin Impiedad lo entregaron a las Inclemencias del Sol y de los Inviernos.

... In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that **the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province**. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that **that vast Map was Useless**, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.

"About six inches to the mile."

"Only six inches!" exclaimed Mein Herr. "We very soon got to six yards to the mile. Then we tried a hundred yards to the mile. And then came the grandest idea of all ! **We actually made a map of the country, on the scale of a mile to the mile!**"

"Have you used it much?" I enquired.

No phenomenon in nature can be understood if considered in isolation, separate from surrounding phenomena

**The error [of Hegel]** lies in the fact that these laws, as laws of thought, are imposed on nature and history, rather than being deduced from them

## (AP) Dialetics: a non-falsiable conjecture {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

Dialectics must be understood as an non-falsifiable conjecture. It should be an inspiration, **but never as something given**. Similar to the Free energy principle (FEP) proposed by Karl Friston [@friston2010].

The whole development of dialectic should be a warning against the dangers inherent in philosophical system-building. It should remind us that **philosophy must not be made a basis for any sort of scientific system** and that philosophers should be much more modest in their claims. One task which they can fulfill quite usefully is the study of the critical methods of science [@popper2002].

Popper disagrees that physical reality develops dialectically

Popper interprets Marx as an economic determinist and historicist

Popper views Marx’s predictions, based on dialectical materialism, as something exact, subject to testing and refutation. At the same time, he points out that some of Marx’s predictions did not hold up when tested against history.

Although Popper praises Marx for his anti-dogmatic stance, he argues that criticisms of dialectical materialism were never tolerated by orthodox Marxists

Popper asserts that the dialectical method is dangerous because it can be used as a form of evasion, thus becoming a tool for reinforcing dogma

## (AP) Popper *versus* Dialetical materialism {visibility="uncounted"}

[...] I want to stress the point that although I should not describe myself as a materialist, **my criticism is not directed against materialism, which I personally should probably prefer to idealism if I were forced to choose (which happily I am not). It is only the combination of dialectic and materialism that appears to me to be even worse than dialectic idealism**.

Nevertheless I personally think that Marx’s economism — his emphasis on the economic background as the ultimate basis of any sort of development — is mistaken and in fact untenable [@popper2002]

According to the materialist conception of history, the ultimately determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life. More than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted. **Hence if somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the only determining one, he transforms that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase** [@engels1978a].

## (AP) Popper *versus* Dialetical materialism {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

For our present purpose it is not so important to analyse Marx’s materialism and economism as to see what has become of the dialectic within his system.
Two points seem to me important. One is Marx’s emphasis on historical method in sociology, a tendency which I have called ‘historicism’. The other is the anti- dogmatic tendency of Marx’s dialectic.

Hence, Marx’s anti-dogmatic attitude exists only in the theory and not in the practice of **orthodox Marxism**, and dialectic is used by Marxists, following the example of Engels’ Anti-Dühring, mainly for the purposes of apologetics to defend the Marxist system against criticism. As a rule critics are denounced for their failure to understand the dialectic, or proletarian science, or for being traitors. **Thanks to dialectic the anti-dogmatic attitude has disappeared, and Marxism has established itself as a dogmatism which is elastic enough, by using its dialectic method, to evade any further attack. It has thus become what I have called a reinforced dogmatism**.

Prophecy certainly need not be unscientific, as predictions of eclipses and other astronomical events show. But **Hegelian dialectic, or its materialistic version, cannot be accepted as a sound basis for scientific forecasts**.

Thus if forecasts based on dialectic are made, some will come true and some will not. In the latter case, obviously, a situation will arise which has not been foreseen. But **dialectic is vague and elastic enough to interpret and to explain this unforeseen situation just as well as it interpreted and explained the situation which it predicted and which happened to come true. Any development whatever will fit the dialectic scheme; the dialectician need never be afraid of any refutation by future experience**.

## (AP) Popper's hypothetico-deductive method {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

The activity can be represented by a **general schema of problem- solving by the method of imaginative conjectures and criticism**, or, as I have often called it, by **the method of conjecture and refutation**. The schema (in its simplest form) is this:

Here $\text{P}_1$, is the *problem* from which we start, $\text{TT}$ (the ‘tentative theory’) is the imaginative conjectural solution which we first reach, for example our first *tentative interpretation*. $\text{EE}$ (‘*error- elimination*’) consists of a severe critical examination of our conjecture, our tentative interpretation: it consists, for example, of the critical use of documentary evidence and, if we have at this early stage more than one conjecture at our disposal, it will also consist of a critical discussion and comparative evaluation of the competing conjectures. $\text{P}_2$ is the problem situation as it emerges from our first critical attempt to solve our problems.
It leads up to our second attempt (*and so on*).

The history of ideas teaches us very clearly that ideas emerge in logical or, if the term is preferred, in **dialectical contexts**. My various schemata such as

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 6.5

flowchart LR
  A(P1) --> B(TT)
  B --> C(EE)
  C --> D(P2)
```

may indeed be looked upon as improvements and rationalizations of the Hegelian dialectical schema: they are rationalizations because they operate entirely within the classical logical organon of rational criticism, which is based upon the so-called law of contradiction; that is to say, upon the demand that contradictions, whenever we discover them, must be eliminated. Critical error-elimination on the scientific level proceeds by way of a **conscious search for contradictions**.

## (AP) Popper against positivism (or the problem of induction) {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

*Notre activité intellectuelle est suffisamment excitée par le pur espoir de découvrir les lois des phénomènes, par le simple désir de **confirmer** ou d'infirmer une théorie. [...] la philosophie positive est le véritable **état définitif** de l'intelligence humaine [...]* [@comte1892, pp. 9-10].

**Why post-positivist?**

- Anti-positivist (positive: “imposed on the mind by experience”)
- Anti-inductivist (deduction, satisfactory answers)
- Anti-verificationist (falsifiability as demarcation criterion)

## (AP) Popper against positivism (or the problem of induction) {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

But I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience. These considerations suggest that **not the _verifiability_ but the _falsifiability_ of a system is to be taken as a criterion of demarcation**. In other words: I shall not require of a scientific system that it shall be capable of being singled out, once and for all, in a positive sense; but I shall require that its logical form shall be such that it can be singled out, by means of empirical tests, in a negative sense: **it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience**.

## (AP) Popper against positivism (or the problem of induction) {visibility="uncounted"}

Everybody knows nowadays that **logical positivism is dead**. But nobody seems to suspect that there may be a question to be asked here — the question “Who is responsible?” or, rather, the question “Who has done it?”. (Passmore’s excellent historical article does not raise this question.) **I fear that I must admit responsibility**.

(@) It is easy to obtain confirmations, or verifications, for nearly every theory —if we look for confirmations
(@) Confirmations should count only if they are the result of *risky predictions*; that is to say, if, unenlightened by the theory in question, we should have expected an event which was incompatible with the theory—an event which would have refuted the theory

(@) Every ‘good’ scientific theory is a prohibition: it forbids certain things to happen. The more a theory forbids, the better it is.
(@) A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is nonscientific.
Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice.

(@) Every genuine *test* of a theory is an attempt to falsify it, or to refute it.
Testability is falsifiability; but there are degrees of testability: some theories are more testable, more exposed to refutation, than others; they take, as it were, greater risks.
(@) Confirming evidence should not count *except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory*; and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory. (I now speak in such cases of ‘corroborating evidence’)

(@) Some genuinely testable theories, when found to be false, are still upheld by their admirers — for example by introducing *ad hoc* some auxiliary assumption, or by re-interpreting the theory *ad hoc* in such a way that it escapes refutation. Such a procedure is always possible, but it rescues the theory from refutation only at the price of destroying, or at least lowering, its scientific status. (I later described such a rescuing operation as a ‘*conventionalist twist*’ or
a ‘*conventionalist stratagem*’).
