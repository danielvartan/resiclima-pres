## What is a complex system? {.nostretch .smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 0.9em; padding-top: 0px;"}
There are several definitions.

* "Systems that don't yield to compact forms of representation or description" (David Krakauer in @mitchell2013);
* "A system of many interacting parts where the system is more than just the sum of its parts" (Mark Newman in @mitchell2013);
* Systems with many connected agents that interact and exhibit self-organization and emergence behavior, all without the need for a central controller (Camilo Rodrigues Neto).
* Dialectics at its finest (my working definition).

[...] just because maximum entropy has low complexity does not mean that low entropy has maximum complexity. It's actually more like this tea and milk. I mean, holding it like this is not very interesting. But as I pour the milk in, the two start to mix and these beautiful patterns emerge. They arise in an instant, and before you know it, they're gone back to being featureless. Both low and high entropy are low in complexity. **It's in the middle where complex structures appear and thrive**.

::: {.notes}
"Entropy is the expected value of surprise." [@starmer2021]

"In the physical sciences, the entropy associated with a situation is a measure of the degree of randomness, or of ‚Äúshuffledness‚Äù if you will, in the situation; and the tendency of physical systems to become less and less organized, to become more and more perfectly shuffled, is so basic that Eddington argues that it is primarily this tendency which gives time its arrow‚Äîwhich would reveal to us, for example, whether a movie of the physical world is being run forward or backward." [@shannon1998]

"That information be measured by entropy is, after all, natural when we remember that information, in communication theory, is associated with the amount of freedom of choice we have in constructing messages. Thus for a communication source one can say, just as he would also say it of a thermodynamic ensemble, ‚ÄúThis situation is highly organized, it is not characterized by a large degree of randomness or of choice‚Äîthat is to say, the information (or the entropy) is low." [@shannon1998]
:::

## Pseudonoise

"It only looks random" [@lorenz2008]

"Chaoplexologists such as Wolfram assume that much of the noise that seems to pervade nature is actually pseudonoise, the result of some underlying, deterministic algorithm." [@horgan2004]

"**Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set off a Tornado in Texas?**" [@lorenz2008]

"Systems in which this is the case are said to be **sensitively dependent on initial conditions**." [@lorenz2008]

"The behavior of some **simple**, **deterministic** systems **can be impossible, even in principle, to predict in the long term**, due to sensitive dependence on initial conditions." [@mitchell2009]

**Order in chaos**: "You can't predict how any individual state will evolve, but you can say how a collection of states evolves." [@muller2019]

"There are these windows of stable periodic behavior amig chaos" (about the Logistic map) [@muller2020]

## Emergence

"Emergence isn't magic" [@wilson2004]

"You are dealing with an emergence phenomenon when there is no *need* to look under the hood." [@krakauer2023]

"There, we defined emergent phenomena to be simply stable macroscopic patterns arising from local interaction of agents." [@epstein1999]

## Emergence

[Smiley: eye - eye - mouth]

## Emergence

**How can something be more than the sum of its parts?**

- A molecule of $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ is water?
- Can you understand a anthill by studying a single ant?
- Are you just a collection of cells?

- "_Uma andorinha n√£o faz ver√£o_".
- "Love is just a chemical".

- Se voc√™ ignorar o todo pelas partes, tudo acaba por  convergir para energia.
- Monism and dualism (idealism).
- Reducionismo.
- Diferentes vis√µes sobre emerg√™ncia

## Emergence

"One singular deception of this sort, which often occurs, is to mistake the sensation produced by our own unclearness of thought for a character of the object we are thinking. Instead of perceiving that the obscurity is purely subjective, we fancy that we contemplate a quality of the object which is essentially mysterious; and if our conception be afterward presented to us in a clear form we do not recognize it as the same, owing to the absence of the feeling of unintelligibility."

## Complexity science {.nostretch .smaller}

[Uma abordagem quantitativa aplicada tamb√©m a sistemas sociais (pol√™mico)]

Parte da concep√ß√£o de Schelling (Nobel) de microbehaviora levam a um macro fen√¥meno.

Hoje sabemos por estudos de, por exemplo Daniel Kahneman, que muito pouco do nosso comportamento √© de fato consciente. Assim como a teoria da energia livre do Karl Friston, teoria n√£o falseavel, como a dial√©tica, tamb√©m sustenta isso.

Se partimos do pressuposto de Schelling (micromotives - macrobehaviors9, podemos ent√£o compreende muitos fen√¥menos sociais (populacionais, n√£o individuais) a partir de modelos baseados em regras, como em simula√ß√µes computacionais.

E essa concep√ß√£o se aplica tamb√©m a outras esp√©cies, como iremos ver no caso dos estoquinhos.

* (System theory) Science or discipline that investigates models, principles, and laws that are valid to systems in general [@bertalanffy1968];
* (System theory) "The attempt of a reductionist scientific tradition to come to terms with complexity, nonlinearity, and change through sophisticated mathematical and computational techniques, _a groping toward a more dialectical understanding_ that is held back by its philosophical biases and the institutional and economic contexts of its development" [@levins1998].

## Other concepts {.smaller}

There are several other concepts in complexity science, such as self-organization, phase transitions, and criticality, that we will not cover in this presentation. However, these concepts are essential for understanding complex systems and their behavior.


<!-- A new method approach of doing science? The generative science -->


## Generative science: a new approach to doing science

Induction: inferring from particular data a general theory.

Deduction: reasoning from first principles to a general theory

Generative: using first principles to generate a particular set of data that can create a general theory

## How it differs from traditional scientific methods {.smaller}

"Simulation is *a third way of doing science*. Like deduction, it starts with a set of explicit assumptions. But unlike deduction, it does not prove theorems. Instead, a simulation generates data that can be analyzed inductively. Unlike typical induction, however, the simulated data comes from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than direct measurement of the real world. While induction can be used to find patterns in data, and deduction can be used to find consequences of assumptions, simulation modeling can be used as *an aid intuition*."

Induction and deduction combined. Deduction is used to generate data that can be analyzed inductively.

## Unintended or unforeseen consequences {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" style="padding-top: 0px;"}
Here we recognize the basic idea of generative science which is **to generate apparently unanticipated and infinite behavior** based on deterministic and finite rules and parameters reproducing or resembling the behavior of natural and social phenomena.

Possible states, even if unlikely: by modelling such interactions, it can suggest that **properties exist in the system that had not been noticed in the real world situation**.

<!-- Entering the world of Agent-based models -->


## Exploring agent-based models

Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational modeling paradigm that enables us to describe how any agent will behave. The methodology of ABM encodes the behavior of individual agents in **simple rules** so that we can observe the results of these agents‚Äô interactions. This technique can be used to model and describe a wide variety of processes, phenomena, and situations, but **it is most useful when describing these phenomena as complex systems**.

Modelos clim√°ticos como x s√£o simula√ß√µes computacionais. Sim! Modelos epidemiol√≥gicos com os modelos do imperial college da COVID-19 s√£o simula√ß√µes computacionais. Sim! Podemos chamar todos eles de modelos baseados em agentes? Sim!

Mas modelos baseados em agentes s√£o muito mais que isso.

## What is a model? {.smaller}

A model is a simplified representation of a system. It can be conceptual, verbal, diagrammatic, physical, or formal (mathematical).

A good model is simple, valid, and robust.

## Types of models {.smaller}

- Equation-based models (EBM) (Mathematical models) (e.g., The ideal gas law: $\text{pV} = \text{nRT}$) [see @avegliano2023; @sayama2015].
- Statistical models: it can be viewed as a subset of mathematical modeling, but is not really the same | e.g., black-box modelling versus regression modelling).
- Physical models.
- Aggregate computer modeling (e.g., system dynamic models).
- Lab experiments (e.g., animal models).
- Agent-based models (ABMs) & Individual-Based Models (Include stochastic effects).

## Basics of agent-based modeling (ABM)

[...] agent-based modeling is clearly a powerful tool in the analysis of spatially distributed systems of heterogeneous autonomous actors with bounded information and computing capacity.

::: footer
[@epstein1999]
:::

## Key components and how they work

- Agents
- Environment
- Interaction

## IBMs *versus* ABMs

There have been historical differences between individual- and agent-based models: IBMs focused on individual variability and local interactions, whereas ABMs focused on decision-making and adaptive behavior. But **these differences are fading away** [...]

Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are typically used in social sciences and economics, while Individual-Based Models (IBMs) are commonly used in ecology and biology.

## Chaos {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

Although the detailed behavior of a chaotic system cannot be predicted, **there is some ‚Äúorder in chaos‚Äù** seen in universal properties common to large sets of chaotic systems, such as the period-doubling route to chaos and Feigenbaum‚Äôs constant. Thus even though ‚Äúprediction becomes impossible‚Äù at the detailed level, there are some higher-level aspects of chaotic systems that are indeed predictable.

We ought then to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its anterior state and as the cause of the one which is to follow. Given for one instant an intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by which nature is animated and the respective situation of the beings who compose it - an intelligence sufficiently vast to submit these data to analysis - it would embrace in the same formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the lightest atom; for it, nothing would be uncertain and the future, as the past, would be present to its eyes.

## (AP) Human difficulties in understanding complex systems {visibility="uncounted"}

"Primate brain": Human beings have difficulty understanding complex systems because they are not designed to do so. Our brains evolved to deal with the immediate environment, not to understand the intricacies of the global economy or the climate system.

Humans have difficult to simulate steps in their minds. We are not good at understanding exponential growth, for example.

## (AP) Dialectical materialism's conjecture {visibility="uncounted"}

Materialists, on the other hand, believe that **only matter and its physical properties are real, while mind, thoughts, and the like are simply manifestations of matter**. The idealist tries to explain physical matter as a by-product of mind; the materialist tries to explain mind as a by-product of matter.

The 4 Fundamental Laws of Dialectical Materialism by Engels and Marx (in opposition to Hegel's idealist dialectic, inspired by Heraclitus):

1. **Reciprocal action of matter in motion**.
2. The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa.
3. The law of the interpenetration of opposites.
4. The law of the negation of the negation.

No phenomenon in nature can be understood if considered in isolation, separate from surrounding phenomena.

**The error [of Hegel]** lies in the fact that these laws, as laws of thought, are imposed on nature and history, rather than being deduced from them.

**Dialectics as the science of interconnections** (sound familiar?).

## (AP) Dialetics and the Law of excluded middle {visibility="uncounted"}

Dialectical materialism will consider that something can be both A and not-A at the same time. This is in opposition to the [Law of excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle), which states that something can only be A or not-A. It assumes a [paraconsistent logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraconsistent_logic), instead of a [classical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic).

## (AP) Dialetics: a non-falsiable conjecture {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

Dialectics must be understood as an non-falsifiable conjecture. It should be an inspiration, **but never as something given**. Similar to the Free energy principle (FEP) proposed by Karl Friston [@friston2010].

"The whole development of dialectic should be a warning against the dangers inherent in philosophical system-building. It should remind us that **philosophy must not be made a basis for any sort of scientific system** and that philosophers should be much more modest in their claims. One task which they can fulfill quite usefully is the study of the critical methods of science." [@popper2002]


## (AP) Popper *versus* Dialetical materialism {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

Popper disagrees that physical reality develops dialectically.

Popper interprets Marx as an economic determinist and historicist.

Popper views Marx‚Äôs predictions, based on dialectical materialism, as something exact, subject to testing and refutation. At the same time, he points out that some of Marx‚Äôs predictions did not hold up when tested against history.

Although Popper praises Marx for his anti-dogmatic stance, he argues that criticisms of dialectical materialism were never tolerated by orthodox Marxists.

Popper asserts that the dialectical method is dangerous because it can be used as a form of evasion, thus becoming a tool for reinforcing dogma.

## (AP) Popper *versus* Dialetical materialism {visibility="uncounted"}

[...] I want to stress the point that although I should not describe myself as a materialist, **my criticism is not directed against materialism, which I personally should probably prefer to idealism if I were forced to choose (which happily I am not). It is only the combination of dialectic and materialism that appears to me to be even worse than dialectic idealism**.

## (AP) Popper *versus* Dialetical materialism {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

"Nevertheless I personally think that Marx‚Äôs economism ‚Äî his emphasis on the economic background as the ultimate basis of any sort of development ‚Äî is mistaken and in fact untenable." [@popper2002]

"According to the materialist conception of history, the ultimately determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life. More than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted. **Hence if somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the only determining one, he transforms that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase**." [@engels1978a]

## (AP) Popper *versus* Dialetical materialism {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

For our present purpose it is not so important to analyse Marx‚Äôs materialism and economism as to see what has become of the dialectic within his system.
Two points seem to me important. One is Marx‚Äôs emphasis on historical method in sociology, a tendency which I have called ‚Äòhistoricism‚Äô. The other is the anti- dogmatic tendency of Marx‚Äôs dialectic.

Hence, Marx‚Äôs anti-dogmatic attitude exists only in the theory and not in the practice of **orthodox Marxism**, and dialectic is used by Marxists, following the example of Engels‚Äô Anti-D√ºhring, mainly for the purposes of apologetics to defend the Marxist system against criticism. As a rule critics are denounced for their failure to understand the dialectic, or proletarian science, or for being traitors. **Thanks to dialectic the anti-dogmatic attitude has disappeared, and Marxism has established itself as a dogmatism which is elastic enough, by using its dialectic method, to evade any further attack. It has thus become what I have called a reinforced dogmatism**.

Prophecy certainly need not be unscientific, as predictions of eclipses and other astronomical events show. But *Hegelian dialectic, or its materialistic version, cannot be accepted as a sound basis for scientific forecasts*.

Thus if forecasts based on dialectic are made, some will come true and some will not. In the latter case, obviously, a situation will arise which has not been foreseen. But **dialectic is vague and elastic enough to interpret and to explain this unforeseen situation just as well as it interpreted and explained the situation which it predicted and which happened to come true. Any development whatever will fit the dialectic scheme; the dialectician need never be afraid of any refutation by future experience**.

## (AP) Popper's hypothetico-deductive method {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

The activity can be represented by a *general schema of problem- solving by the method of imaginative conjectures and criticism*, or, as I have often called it, by *the method of conjecture and refutation*. The schema (in its simplest form) is this:

## (AP) Popper's hypothetico-deductive method {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

Here $\text{P}_1$, is the *problem* from which we start, $\text{TT}$ (the ‚Äòtentative theory‚Äô) is the imaginative conjectural solution which we first reach, for example our first *tentative interpretation*. $\text{EE}$ (‚Äò*error- elimination*‚Äô) consists of a severe critical examination of our conjecture, our tentative interpretation: it consists, for example, of the critical use of documentary evidence and, if we have at this early stage more than one conjecture at our disposal, it will also consist of a critical discussion and comparative evaluation of the competing conjectures. $\text{P}_2$ is the problem situation as it emerges from our first critical attempt to solve our problems.
It leads up to our second attempt (*and so on*).

## (AP) Popper's hypothetico-deductive method {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

The history of ideas teaches us very clearly that ideas emerge in logical or, if the term is preferred, in **dialectical contexts**. My various schemata such as

$$
\text{P}_1 \rightarrow \text{TT} \rightarrow \text{EE} \rightarrow \text{P}_2
$$

may indeed be looked upon as improvements and rationalizations of the Hegelian dialectical schema: they are rationalizations because they operate entirely within the classical logical organon of rational criticism, which is based upon the so-called law of contradiction; that is to say, upon the demand that contradictions, whenever we discover them, must be eliminated. Critical error-elimination on the scientific level proceeds by way of a **conscious search for contradictions**.

**Why post-positivist?**

- Anti-positivist (positive: ‚Äúimposed on the mind by experience‚Äù).

- Anti-verificationist (falsifiability as demarcation criterion).

## (AP) Popper against positivism (or the problem of induction) {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

But I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience. These considerations suggest that **not the _verifiability_ but the _falsifiability_ of a system is to be taken as a criterion of demarcation**. In other words: I shall not require of a scientific system that it shall be capable of being singled out, once and for all, in a positive sense; but I shall require that its logical form shall be such that it can be singled out, by means of empirical tests, in a negative sense: *it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience*.
