# Key concepts of complex systems [line 36]

## Complex *versus* Complicated [line 38]

A biological clock is complex, but a mechanical clock is complicated.

## Complex *versus* Complicated [line 58]

A look at the internals of a mechanical clock.

Elegant and Precise

A watchmaker designed it. It has a specific function. It has a goal.

It may be hard to understand, but if you take the time and look at all of its parts, you can understand the whole system.

## Complex *versus* Complicated [line 76]

A look at the internals of a biological clock (a timing system).

A mess! A bunch of coupled oscillators

"[...] involve great numbers of parts undergoing a kaleidoscopic array of simultaneous interactions." [@holland1992b]

If you look just its parts, you can't understand the whole system.

It's an emergent phenomenon.

It can be thought as an "aggregate agent" ‚Äï aggregate behavior of component agents generates behavior of the aggregate agent. [@holland2012]

Boundaries and signals [@holland2012]

It's adaptive, robust, produces extreme events, and is self-organized.

## Emergence [line 106]

(joke) Power Rangers Megazord.

"Esquece o jovem m√≠stico".

Illustrative example: Societies; immune cells.

A society is formed by individuals and their interactions. In this case, we are the agents and the society is the aggregate agent. And, as we know, we shape the society, but the society also shapes us.

**Emergence isn't magic** [@wilson2004].

You are dealing with an emergence phenomenon when there is no need to look under the hood [@krakauer2023].

Levels of description [@nicolis2012].

## Chaos [line 140]

Seemingly random behavior can emerge from deterministic systems, with no external source of randomness [@mitchell2009].

## Generative science [line 197]

Like **deduction**, it starts with a set of explicit assumptions. But unlike deduction, it does not prove theorems. Instead, a simulation generates data that can be analyzed inductively.

Unlike typical **induction**, however, the simulated data comes from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than direct measurement of the real world.

While induction can be used to find patterns in data, and deduction can be used to find consequences of assumptions, simulation modeling can be used as **an aid intuition**.

# Entering the world of agent-based models [line 229]

The main objective of this section is to introduce the concept of agent-based models (ABMs) and other important concepts related to modeling in general.

## Agent-based models [line 235]

## The modeling cycle [line 262]

We have to force ourselves to simplify as much as we can, or even more. The modeling cycle must be started with the most simple model possible, because we want to develop understanding gradually, while iterating through the cycle. A common mistake of begin- ners is to throw too much into the first model version‚Äîusually arguing that all these factors are well known and can‚Äôt possibly be ignored. The modeling expert‚Äôs answer to this is, yes, you might be right, but‚Äîlet us focus on the absolute minimum number of factors first. Put all the other elements that you think might need to be in the model on your ‚Äúwish list‚Äù and check their importance later [@railsback2019, p. 8].

If someone designed this here, they weren't doing well. This system wasn't designed by a watchmaker, but by evolution.

This is the result of a juggling act of billions of years of evolution. There are no specific functions. There's no proposed goal.

You would hate have this clock. You would be late for everything. Its always changing. That's because it's not a clock, it's a timing system.

## (AP) Untangling *versus* Entangling [line 797]

Agent-based modeling is ‚Äúnaive‚Äù (DeAngelis et al. 1994) in the sense that we are not trying to aggregate agents and what they are doing in some abstract variables like abundance, biomass, overall wealth, demo- graphic rates, or nutrient fluxes. Instead, we naively and directly represent the agents and their behavior. We create these agents, put them in a virtual environment, and then let the virtual world run and see what we can learn from it [@railsback2019, pp. 7-8]

## (AP) Emergence [line 813]

Microscopic patterns that accumulate over time, similarly to evolutionary patterns.

## (AP) Emergence [line 836]

## (AP) Emergence [line 847]

Emergence shares similarities with evolution. On shorter time scales, we observe the formation of patterns. Over longer time scales, entirely new levels of organization appear, leading to phenomena that seem unrelated to their origins (e.g., a rock and a human).

## (AP) Why use ABM? [line 1170]

By my own experience. Use of ABM in the classroom (Camilo, 2012).

You don‚Äôt need to invest in infrastructure to run simulations. You can use your own machine or cloud computing services to execute them.

## (AP) Types of models [line 1196]

ABMs can also be implemented in continuous time, but most are designed as discrete-time simulations.

Simple model example: Schelling's segregation model [@schelling1971].

We call this the ‚ÄòMedawar zone‚Äô because Medawar described a similar relation between the difficulty of a scientific problem and its payoff [@grimm2005a].

## (AP) A picture is worth a thousand words [line 1492]

Understanding local interactions helps identify potential leverage points or types of interactions that can amplify the spread of a phenomenon. For instance, by analyzing contact interactions, one might recommend mask usage or design specific protocols for tracking and isolating infected individuals. A global approach, on its own, would not reveal these crucial details.
