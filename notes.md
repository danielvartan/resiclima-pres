## Complex *versus* Complicated [line 33]

A biological clock is complex, but a mechanical clock is complicated.

## Complex *versus* Complicated [line 53]

A look at the internals of a mechanical clock.

Elegant and Precise

A watchmaker designed it. It has a specific function. It has a goal.

It may be hard to understand, but if you take the time and look at all of its parts, you can understand the whole system.

## Complex *versus* Complicated [line 71]

A look at the internals of a biological clock (a timing system).

A mess! A bunch of coupled oscillators

"[...] involve great numbers of parts undergoing a kaleidoscopic array of simultaneous interactions." [@holland1992b]

If you look just its parts, you can't understand the whole system.

It's an emergent phenomenon

It can be thought as an "aggregate agent" â€• aggregate behavior of component agents generates behavior of the aggregate agent. [@holland2012]

Boundaries and signals [@holland2012]

It's adaptive, robust, produces extreme events, and is self-organized.

## Complex *versus* Complicated [line 101]

Illustrative example: Societies; immune cells.

A society is formed by individuals and their interactions. In this case, we are the agents and the society is the aggregate agent. And, as we know, we shape the society, but the society also shapes us.

## Emergence [line 282]

Microscopic patterns that accumulate over time, similarly to evolutionary patterns.

## Emergence [line 305]

Emergence shares similarities with evolution. On shorter time scales, we observe the formation of patterns. Over longer time scales, entirely new levels of organization appear, leading to phenomena that seem unrelated to their origins (e.g., a rock and a human).

## Generative science [line 352]

Like **deduction**, it starts with a set of explicit assumptions. But unlike deduction, it does not prove theorems. Instead, a simulation generates data that can be analyzed inductively.

Unlike typical **induction**, however, the simulated data comes from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than direct measurement of the real world.

While induction can be used to find patterns in data, and deduction can be used to find consequences of assumptions, simulation modeling can be used as **an aid intuition**.

"Figure 1.1: Visual, organizational map of complex systems science broken into seven topical areas. The three circles on the left (Nonlinear Dynamics, Systems Theory, and Game Theory) are the historical roots of complex systems science, while the other four circles (Pattern Formation, Evolution and Adaptation, Networks, and Collective Behavior) are the more recently studied topical areas." [@sayama2015].

## Other concepts [line 406]

# Entering the world of agent-based models [line 439]

The main objective of this section is to introduce the concept of agent-based models (ABMs) and other important concepts related to modeling in general.

## Agent-based models [line 445]

## Types of models [line 472]

ABMs can also be implemented in continuous time, but most are designed as discrete-time simulations.

Joke: You can always use other tools, but know that I will judge you for that.

## Verification and validation [line 606]

## Why use ABM? [line 638]

By my own experience. Use of ABM in the classroom (Camilo, 2012).

You donâ€™t need to invest in infrastructure to run simulations. You can use your own machine or cloud computing services to execute them.

If someone designed this here, they weren't doing well. This system wasn't designed by a watchmaker, but by evolution.

This is the result of a juggling act of billions of years of evolution. There are no specific functions. There's no proposed goal.

You would hate have this clock. You would be late for everything. Its always changing. That's because it's not a clock, it's a timing system.

Simple model example: Schelling's segregation model [@schelling1971].

We call this the â€˜Medawar zoneâ€™ because Medawar described a similar relation between the difficulty of a scientific problem and its payoff [@grimm2005a].
