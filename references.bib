  abstract = {Adaptive agents must occupy a limited repertoire of states and therefore minimize the long-term average of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world. Minimizing surprise enables them to resist a natural tendency to disorder.  Surprise rests on predictions about sensations, which depend on an internal generative model of the world. Although surprise cannot be measured directly, a free-energy bound on surprise can be, suggesting that agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions (perception) or by changing the predicted sensory inputs (action).Perception optimizes predictions by minimizing free energy with respect to synaptic activity (perceptual inference), efficacy (learning and memory) and gain (attention and salience). This furnishes Bayes-optimal (probabilistic) representations of what caused sensations (providing a link to the Bayesian brain hypothesis).Bayes-optimal perception is mathematically equivalent to predictive coding and maximizing the mutual information between sensations and the representations of their causes. This is a probabilistic generalization of the principle of efficient coding (the infomax principle) or the minimum-redundancy principle.Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the sensorium. This rests on associative plasticity to encode causal regularities and appeals to the same synaptic mechanisms as those underlying cell assembly formation.Action under the free-energy principle reduces to suppressing sensory prediction errors that depend on predicted (expected or desired) movement trajectories. This provides a simple account of motor control, in which action is enslaved by perceptual (proprioceptive) predictions.Perceptual predictions rest on prior expectations about the trajectory or movement through the agent's state space. These priors can be acquired (as empirical priors during hierarchical inference) or they can be innate (epigenetic) and therefore subject to selective pressure.Predicted motion or state transitions realized by action correspond to policies in optimal control theory and reinforcement learning. In this context, value is inversely proportional to surprise (and implicitly free energy), and rewards correspond to innate priors that constrain policies.},

This book provides an introduction to one of the primary methodologies for research in this new field of knowledge. Agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a new way of doing science: by conducting computer-based experiments. ABM is applicable to complex systems embedded in natural, social, and engineered contexts, across domains that range from engineering to ecology. An Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling offers a comprehensive description of the core concepts, methods, and applications of ABM. Its hands-on approach—with hundreds of examples and exercises using NetLogo—enables readers to begin constructing models immediately, regardless of experience or discipline.The book first describes the nature and rationale of agent-based modeling, then presents the methodology for designing and building ABMs, and finally discusses how to utilize ABMs to answer complex questions. Features in each chapter include step-by-step guides to developing models in the main text; text boxes with additional information and concepts; end-of-chapter explorations; and references and lists of relevant reading. There is also an accompanying website with all the models and code.},

Since assumptions imply some kind of scientific model, I believe that it is necessary to look at the process of scientific modelling itself to understand the nature of and the need for robust procedures. Against such a view it might be urged that some useful robust procedures have been derived empirically without an explicitly stated model. However, an empirical procedure implies some unstated model and there is often great virtue in bringing into the open the kind of assumptions that lead to useful methods. The need for robust methods seems to be intimately mixed up with the need for simple models. This we now discuss.},

However, there’s still a literature gap in evaluating food systems alongside the global syndemic using the complex systems theory, especially concerning vulnerable populations like children. This research aimed to design a system dynamics model to advance a theoretical understanding of the connections between food systems and the global syndemic, particularly focusing on their impacts on children under five years of age. The framework was developed through a literature review and authors’ insights into the relationships between the food, health, and environmental components of the global syndemic among children. The conceptual model presented 17 factors, with 26 connections and 6 feedback loops, categorized into the following 5 groups: environmental, economic, school-related, family-related, and child-related. It delineated and elucidated mechanisms among the components of the global syndemic encompassing being overweight, suffering from undernutrition, and climate change. The findings unveiled potential interactions within food systems and health outcomes. Furthermore, the model integrated elements of the socio-ecological model by incorporating an external layer representing the environment and its natural resources. Consequently, the development of public policies and interventions should encompass environmental considerations to effectively tackle the complex challenges posed by the global syndemic.},

  abstract = {This article argues that the agent-based computational model permits a distinctive approach to social science for which the term "generative" is suitable. In defending this terminology, features distinguishing the approach from both "inductive" and "deductive" science are given. Then, the following specific contributions to social science are discussed: The agent-based computational model is a new tool for empirical research. It offers a natural environment for the study of connectionist phenomena in social science. Agent-based modeling pro- vides a powerful way to address certain enduring-and especially interdisciplinary questions. It allows one to subject certain core theories-such as neoclassical microeconomics-to important types of stress (e.g., the effect of evolving preferences). It permits one to study how rules of individual behavior give rise-or "map up"-to macroscopic regularities and organizations. In turn, one can employ laboratory behavioral research findings to select among competing agent-based ("bottom up") models. The agent-based approach may well have the important effect of decoupling individual rationality from macroscopic equilibrium and of separating decision science from social science more generally. Agent-based modeling offers powerful new forms of hybrid theo- retical-computational work; these are particularly relevant to the study of non-equilibrium systems. The agent- based approach invites the interpretation of society as a distributed computational device, and in turn the interpretation of social dynamics as a type of computation. This interpretation raises important foundational issues in social science-some related to intractability, and some to undecidability proper. Finally, since "emer- gence" figures prominently in this literature, I take up the connection between agent-based modeling and classical emergentism, criticizing the latter and arguing that the two are incompatible.},

  abstract = {Pondering the hard problem of consciousness, Simon Blackburn quite rightly describes “old-fashioned emergence” of mind from brain as “magic tissue secreting a magical effect” (11 September, p 42). But this does not mean emergence necessarily entails smoke and mirrors. It is a familiar phenomenon that science helps us to understand. As we learn in school, if you chemically combine the gases oxygen and hydrogen the result is liquid water. There is no magic involved in the fact that the properties of water are different from its constituent elements. Equally, the emergence of consciousness from certain arrangements of neurons is a natural process. The problem of how it comes about is hard because we have only just begun to investigate the complexity of the brain. While agreeing that neuroscientists can benefit from critical analysis of their ideas by philosophers, the latter tend to be led astray by metaphysical speculation. The Cartesian dualist tradition is a case in point. Modern dualists such as David Chalmers argue that the emergence of consciousness from the brain is not just remarkable, but logically impossible. And so it would be if Descartes’ claim that the conscious mind is separate from the mechanistic body were true. Assuming a logical division between the mental and the physical begs the mind-body question. Mental and physical properties do appear to be radically different but we simply don’t know whether this is a real difference. Bicester, Oxfordshire, UK},

  abstract = {Finite systems of deterministic ordinary nonlinear differential equations may be designed to represent forced dissipative hydrodynamic flow. Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

  abstract = {Engineers design mindful of the purpose of a system. So, engineering conceptual definitions of the concept of “system” frequently include the idea of purpose. However, we also use “system” to describe things not human-designed. We might refer to purpose in living systems, as in the immune system, but biologists use “function” to avoid this. What about inanimate natural systems? Do Saturn's rings have a purpose, or function? And what about pathologies, when systems don't work as they “should”? Do all these “systems” terms and concepts serve us well across these different domains, or are some force-fit? Using the language of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Pattern-Based Systems Engineering (PBSE), this paper describes a framework in which “system” and “purpose” emerge at different levels, apply uniformly, naturally, or not at all, and inform. The framework is the Systems of Innovation (SOI) Pattern. Practical benefits include insights into the nature of innovation across these domains, improving ability to perform innovative systems engineering.},

  abstract = {One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.},
