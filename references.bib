  abstract = {In this work, we propose 2LevelCalibration, a multi-stage approach for the calibration of unknown parameters of agent-based models. First, we detail the aspects of agent-based models that make this task so cumbersome. Then, we conduct extensive research on common methods applied for this purpose in other domains, highlighting the strong points of each approach that could be explored to efficiently calibrate the parameters of agent-based models. Finally, we present a multi-stage method for this task, 2LevelCalibration, which benefits from the simplicity of equation-based models, used to faster explore a large set of possible combinations of parameters and to quickly select the more promising ones. These values are then analysed more carefully in the second step of our method, which performs the calibration of the agent-based model parameters' near the region of the search space that potentially contains the best set of parameters, previously identified in our method. This strategy outperformed traditional techniques when tested to calibrate the parameters of an agent-based model to replicate real-world observations of the housing market. With this testbed, we show that our method has highly desirable characteristics such as lightweight implementation and consistency, which are ideal for agent-based models' development process.},

Since assumptions imply some kind of scientific model, I believe that it is necessary to look at the process of scientific modelling itself to understand the nature of and the need for robust procedures. Against such a view it might be urged that some useful robust procedures have been derived empirically without an explicitly stated model. However, an empirical procedure implies some unstated model and there is often great virtue in bringing into the open the kind of assumptions that lead to useful methods. The need for robust methods seems to be intimately mixed up with the need for simple models. This we now discuss.},

As influential today as when it was first published, The Selfish Gene has become a classic exposition of evolutionary thought. Professor Dawkins articulates a gene's eye view of evolution - a view giving centre stage to these persistent units of information, and in which organisms can be seen as vehicles for their replication. This imaginative, powerful, and stylistically brilliant work not only brought the insights of Neo-Darwinism to a wide audience, but galvanized the biology community, generating much debate and stimulating whole new areas of research. Forty years later, its insights remain as relevant today as on the day it was published. This 40th anniversary edition includes a new epilogue from the author discussing the continuing relevance of these ideas in evolutionary biology today, as well as the original prefaces and foreword, and extracts from early reviews. Oxford Landmark Science books are 'must-read' classics of modern science writing which have crystallized big ideas, and shaped the way we think.},

  abstract = {This article argues that the agent-based computational model permits a distinctive approach to social science for which the term "generative" is suitable. In defending this terminology, features distinguishing the approach from both "inductive" and "deductive" science are given. Then, the following specific contributions to social science are discussed: The agent-based computational model is a new tool for empirical research. It offers a natural environment for the study of connectionist phenomena in social science. Agent-based modeling pro- vides a powerful way to address certain enduring-and especially interdisciplinary questions. It allows one to subject certain core theories-such as neoclassical microeconomics-to important types of stress (e.g., the effect of evolving preferences). It permits one to study how rules of individual behavior give rise-or "map up"-to macroscopic regularities and organizations. In turn, one can employ laboratory behavioral research findings to select among competing agent-based ("bottom up") models. The agent-based approach may well have the important effect of decoupling individual rationality from macroscopic equilibrium and of separating decision science from social science more generally. Agent-based modeling offers powerful new forms of hybrid theo- retical-computational work; these are particularly relevant to the study of non-equilibrium systems. The agent- based approach invites the interpretation of society as a distributed computational device, and in turn the interpretation of social dynamics as a type of computation. This interpretation raises important foundational issues in social science-some related to intractability, and some to undecidability proper. Finally, since "emer- gence" figures prominently in this literature, I take up the connection between agent-based modeling and classical emergentism, criticizing the latter and arguing that the two are incompatible.},

  abstract = {Adaptive agents must occupy a limited repertoire of states and therefore minimize the long-term average of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world. Minimizing surprise enables them to resist a natural tendency to disorder.  Surprise rests on predictions about sensations, which depend on an internal generative model of the world. Although surprise cannot be measured directly, a free-energy bound on surprise can be, suggesting that agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions (perception) or by changing the predicted sensory inputs (action).Perception optimizes predictions by minimizing free energy with respect to synaptic activity (perceptual inference), efficacy (learning and memory) and gain (attention and salience). This furnishes Bayes-optimal (probabilistic) representations of what caused sensations (providing a link to the Bayesian brain hypothesis).Bayes-optimal perception is mathematically equivalent to predictive coding and maximizing the mutual information between sensations and the representations of their causes. This is a probabilistic generalization of the principle of efficient coding (the infomax principle) or the minimum-redundancy principle.Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the sensorium. This rests on associative plasticity to encode causal regularities and appeals to the same synaptic mechanisms as those underlying cell assembly formation.Action under the free-energy principle reduces to suppressing sensory prediction errors that depend on predicted (expected or desired) movement trajectories. This provides a simple account of motor control, in which action is enslaved by perceptual (proprioceptive) predictions.Perceptual predictions rest on prior expectations about the trajectory or movement through the agent's state space. These priors can be acquired (as empirical priors during hierarchical inference) or they can be innate (epigenetic) and therefore subject to selective pressure.Predicted motion or state transitions realized by action correspond to policies in optimal control theory and reinforcement learning. In this context, value is inversely proportional to surprise (and implicitly free energy), and rewards correspond to innate priors that constrain policies.},

  abstract = {Entropy is a fundamental concept in Data Science because it shows up all over the place - from Decision Trees, to similarity metrics, to state of the art dimension reduction algorithms. It's also surprisingly simple, but often poorly explained. Traditionally the equation is presented with the expectation that you memorize it without thoroughly understanding what it means and where it came from. This video takes a very different approach by showing you, step-by-step, where this simple equation comes from, making it easy to remember (and derive), understand and explain to your friends at parties.

  abstract = {A comprehensive and hands-on introduction to the core concepts, methods, and applications of agent-based modeling, including detailed NetLogo examples.The advent of widespread fast computing has enabled us to work on more complex problems and to build and analyze more complex models. This book provides an introduction to one of the primary methodologies for research in this new field of knowledge. Agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a new way of doing science: by conducting computer-based experiments. ABM is applicable to complex systems embedded in natural, social, and engineered contexts, across domains that range from engineering to ecology. An Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling offers a comprehensive description of the core concepts, methods, and applications of ABM. Its hands-on approach—with hundreds of examples and exercises using NetLogo—enables readers to begin constructing models immediately, regardless of experience or discipline.The book first describes the nature and rationale of agent-based modeling, then presents the methodology for designing and building ABMs, and finally discusses how to utilize ABMs to answer complex questions. Features in each chapter include step-by-step guides to developing models in the main text; text boxes with additional information and concepts; end-of-chapter explorations; and references and lists of relevant reading. There is also an accompanying website with all the models and code.},

  abstract = {Pondering the hard problem of consciousness, Simon Blackburn quite rightly describes “old-fashioned emergence” of mind from brain as “magic tissue secreting a magical effect” (11 September, p 42). But this does not mean emergence necessarily entails smoke and mirrors. It is a familiar phenomenon that science helps us to understand. As we learn in school, if you chemically combine the gases oxygen and hydrogen the result is liquid water. There is no magic involved in the fact that the properties of water are different from its constituent elements. Equally, the emergence of consciousness from certain arrangements of neurons is a natural process. The problem of how it comes about is hard because we have only just begun to investigate the complexity of the brain. While agreeing that neuroscientists can benefit from critical analysis of their ideas by philosophers, the latter tend to be led astray by metaphysical speculation. The Cartesian dualist tradition is a case in point. Modern dualists such as David Chalmers argue that the emergence of consciousness from the brain is not just remarkable, but logically impossible. And so it would be if Descartes’ claim that the conscious mind is separate from the mechanistic body were true. Assuming a logical division between the mental and the physical begs the mind-body question. Mental and physical properties do appear to be radically different but we simply don’t know whether this is a real difference. Bicester, Oxfordshire, UK},
