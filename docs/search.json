    "text": "Summary of key takeaways\nComplex systems are systems with many interconnected parts that exhibit emergent behavior.\nAgent-based models are stochastic computational models with the purpose of simulating the behavior of agents and their interactions, allowing us to study emergent phenomena.\nABMs are useful for modeling complex systems and can be used in a wide variety of fields, including social sciences, epidemiology, archaeology, ecology, and many others."

The other is the anti- dogmatic tendency of Marx‚Äôs dialectic.\nHence, Marx‚Äôs anti-dogmatic attitude exists only in the theory and not in the practice of orthodox Marxism, and dialectic is used by Marxists, following the example of Engels‚Äô Anti-D√ºhring, mainly for the purposes of apologetics to defend the Marxist system against criticism. As a rule critics are denounced for their failure to understand the dialectic, or proletarian science, or for being traitors. Thanks to dialectic the anti-dogmatic attitude has disappeared, and Marxism has established itself as a dogmatism which is elastic enough, by using its dialectic method, to evade any further attack.
