More than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted.

    "text": "(AP) Popper versus Dialetical materialism\nFor our present purpose it is not so important to analyse Marx‚Äôs materialism and economism as to see what has become of the dialectic within his system. Two points seem to me important. One is Marx‚Äôs emphasis on historical method in sociology, a tendency which I have called ‚Äòhistoricism‚Äô. The other is the anti- dogmatic tendency of Marx‚Äôs dialectic.\nHence, Marx‚Äôs anti-dogmatic attitude exists only in the theory and not in the practice of orthodox Marxism, and dialectic is used by Marxists, following the example of Engels‚Äô Anti-D√ºhring, mainly for the purposes of apologetics to defend the Marxist system against criticism. As a rule critics are denounced for their failure to understand the dialectic, or proletarian science, or for being traitors. Thanks to dialectic the anti-dogmatic attitude has disappeared, and Marxism has established itself as a dogmatism which is elastic enough, by using its dialectic method, to evade any further attack. It has thus become what I have called a reinforced dogmatism.\n\n(K. R. Popper, 2002)"

In the latter case, obviously, a situation will arise which has not been foreseen. But dialectic is vague and elastic enough to interpret and to explain this unforeseen situation just as well as it interpreted and explained the situation which it predicted and which happened to come true.
